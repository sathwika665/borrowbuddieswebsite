      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <p>At <strong>BORROW BUDDIES</strong>, we believe in building a strong community where neighbors can help each other by lending the things they own in exchange for a little cash. Whether it's a lawnmower, a bicycle, or a power tool, you can easily lend and borrow items from people in your neighborhood. It's a simple, sustainable way to save money, reduce waste, and build lasting relationships.</p>
      <p>We started with a vision to make everyday items more accessible, fostering a sense of trust and community among neighbors. With BORROW BUDDIES, sharing resources becomes easier, ensuring that you can find what you need without buying new.</p>
      <p>Join us in making a positive impact on your neighborhood while earning extra money through lending!</p>
